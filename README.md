## Various scripts to automate tasks on Linux

+ **compile** *-A simple script I wrote that will automate compilation with
  the Arch Build System. Can compile packages with `compile
  <package-name>` from any of the standard Arch repos. There
  are two versions. One is a shell script and the other is in C.

Anything that isn't a shell script has source code in src folder.

Required packages (Arch Linux): base-devel, subversion

kernel has been moved to it's own repository [custom-kernel-manager](https://www.github.com/cjmcguire88/custom-kernel-manager) as it's become a bit more than a script at this point.
